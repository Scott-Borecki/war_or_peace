### <ins>Overview</ins>

[War or Peace](https://github.com/Scott-Borecki/war_or_peace) is a 6-day, solo project during the first week of Mod 1 of 4, for Turing School's Back End Engineering Program.

My challenge was to write a program to simulate a game of the classic card game [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). A user will be able to create two players, and watch them â€˜playâ€™ the game.

Learning goals and areas of focus consisted of:

- Follow an interaction pattern
- Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
- Write tests
- Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
- Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request
- [Technical Requirements](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/war_or_peace/)
